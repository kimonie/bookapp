Chapter 1: Dear Mark

The letter sat half-written on the table, a narrow slant of late-afternoon light tracing the curve of Lily’s shoulder. Dust hung still in the sunbeam, caught like indecision. Outside, Florence whispered in terracotta rooftops and soft echoes of street vendors, but within these walls silence ruled.
Lily leaned back in the worn leather chair her father once occupied, arms folded, eyes locked on the sentence that refused to resolve. The soft hum of the building’s intercom had cut out twice that day static bursts she tried not to read as surveillance.
“I’ve been meaning to write this for a while now…”
She read it aloud, almost a whisper. The paper trembled slightly beneath her fingers.
No good.
She scratched it out with precise strokes, as if carving doubt from stone. The pen, one of her father’s old Montblancs, made a soft, deliberate scrape against the heavy stationery.
She had written dozens of drafts over the last two weeks. And each time she sent one to the courier’s drop point, she swore the same unfamiliar figure passed her stairwell. Coincidence, she told herself. But her pulse disagreed. Some bled with vulnerability, others coiled tight with suspicion. None had struck the right tone. This letter couldn’t scream revenge it had to whisper love. Or at least its convincing shadow.
She began again.
“Dear Mark, I’ve been meaning to write this for a while now, but every time I’d start, I’d stop...”
Her hand moved faster this time. As if her heart had finally decided to speak, though she knew better. It wasn’t her heart guiding her now. It was the mind that remembered details: the way Mark flinched ever so slightly when her father’s name was mentioned, how he’d changed the subject when talk of the Circle surfaced.
And yet.
She paused. Her reflection, caught faintly in the glass of the bookshelf, looked unfamiliar. Softer. Younger.
There had been that one night, on the Ponte Vecchio, when the world had felt strangely safe. Mark had touched her elbow to steady her, and she’d felt something unguarded in him. It had been easy then, too easy, to forget what he represented. That he worked for the Delacroix Foundation. That he smiled like a man with nothing to hide.
She dipped the pen again and continued writing. Slowly, carefully, shaping each sentence like a fragment of something true.
“But the truth is, you’re always there, on my mind, whether I like it or not...”
The words spilled in the voice of someone she once was, or might have been, if the world had stayed whole. That was the trick, wasn’t it? It had to sound like longing. Not manipulation. Not warning.
Still, it wasn’t fiction. Not entirely. She had loved him, once. Or something dangerously close.
A breeze stirred through the open balcony doors, fluttering the edge of a map pinned to the far wall. Florence, annotated in her father’s hand. She’d stopped trying to erase the ghost of him. Now she simply walked beside it.
Lily capped the pen, breathing in the faint ink-smoke scent that always reminded her of his study. She re-read the letter from the top, line by line. Her stomach twisted as if the words might suddenly rearrange into a confession of her own.
“I love you,” it ended. “If there’s even a small part of you that feels the same…”
She closed her eyes. Held still.
When she opened them, the mask returned, quiet precision behind her gaze. She folded the letter once, then again, and slid it into the envelope. Her fingers lingered over the paper as if it still radiated warmth.
From a drawer beneath the table, she retrieved a silver wax seal and a stick of black wax. The color was deliberate. Mourning and elegance. She melted the end over a candle flame, let it drip, then pressed the seal: a single eye inside a keyhole.
Not her symbol. Not yet. But a signal nonetheless.
Then, with care, she slid a micro-sensor beneath the flap.  The last time she’d used one, the response came too quickly, as if someone else had been listening. No larger than a sesame seed, impossible to spot unless you knew where to look.
This was the bait.
She would know when he opened it. Where he opened it. Whether he read it alone.
The part of her that wanted answers hated this methodical deception. But answers required control. And control demanded sacrifice.
Lily stood and walked to the balcony, envelope in hand. Below, the city breathed with the scent of espresso and stone. The courier’s motorbike waited two streets over, pre-scheduled, anonymous.
She held the envelope a moment longer. Long enough to feel the weight of what might come next.
Mark might respond with silence.
Or with something worse: the right words.
The wind tugged at her hair, lifting a strand across her cheek. She tucked it behind her ear and descended the narrow staircase.
By the time she returned, the sun had dipped lower, the apartment painted in amber. On the desk, the pen rested where she’d left it. Still warm from use.
Lily poured herself a glass of wine, deep red, like confession, and stood in the window as shadows lengthened across the Arno.
She had sent the letter as bait.
But that didn’t mean the feelings inside it were false.
That was the problem with history. Even when it was a lie, someone always believed it once.
